# Saving Components

Once users have created and rendered their component, they can add it to their component library by clicking on the **Save Component** button. 

To access their library, they can click on the **Saved Components** button located on the Navbar. 

The library provides various options to manage saved components such as searching, rendering, exporting to projects, or deleting a component.

Additionally, the library displays the render time for each component. Users can utilize this to compare and contrast render times of saved components to identify bottlenecks.
