# Introduction

## Introduction to AthenaJS:

AthenaJS is a standalone Electron application that streamlines the development process of React components. Its key feature is the ability to **develop individual components in isolation**, allowing for rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration. By providing a dedicated environment for component creation, AthenaJS enhances efficiency and promotes best practices in React development.

### Key Features of AthenaJS Include:

- **Intuitive interface** for editing components or building components from scratch. This includes a built-in linter for JavaScript and JSX.

- **Live component rendering**, making it easy to visualize and test components on the fly.

- **Render time calculation & graphing**, allowing developers to identify bottlenecks in their application.

- **Save & Export** functionality to save your progress and integrate updated components seamlessly into your React application.

- **Fetch-Mock Integration** to mock http requests for your components making API requests

- **Styled Components Integration** to quickly style your components

- **User Interface Whiteboard**, allowing developers to compare components and prototype UIs with intuitive drag and drop area

## Prerequisities

To get started with AthenaJS, it's important to ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Compatible operating system**: AthenaJS is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Basic knowledge of React**: Familiarity with React and its core concepts is highly recommended to use AthenaJS effectively.

Once you have met these prerequisites, you can install AthenaJS and begin developing React components with enhanced performance insights and efficient workflows.
