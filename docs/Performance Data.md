# Performance Data

When a user renders a component on the Component Workshop or Saved Components pages, the render data for that component is displayed on the top-right corner of the screen. 

Users can create a label for this render instance and save it using the **Add Data** button.

Once users have saved render times for a set of components, they can navigate to the **Performance** tab to view a bar graph that shows the render times for each component side by side. This graph enables developers to identify performance bottlenecks in their React app and optimize their code accordingly.
