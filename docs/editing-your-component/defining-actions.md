# Mocking Functions

In AthenaJS, the function terminal window is a powerful tool that allows users to import and define functions from component files to test and render components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the function terminal window:

- **Access the function terminal window**: Locate the function terminal window in the bottom-middle of the AthenaJS UI. This window is dedicated to creating and managing functions for your isolated component.

- **Load the component file**: Use the "Load File" button to load your component file into AthenaJS. The component file will be parsed, and all of the functions defined in the file will be loaded into the function terminal window.

- **Define functions in the function terminal window**: In the function terminal window, you can define functions or modify the existing ones that have been loaded from the component file. For example, you can define a function named `handleClick` that changes the state of the component when called. The syntax for defining a function in the function terminal window is the same as in a regular JavaScript file.

- **Utilize the functions in the component**: Once the functions have been defined or imported in the function terminal window, they can be utilized in the component. You can call the functions in the JSX terminal window, passing in any necessary parameters.

- **Preview the component**: The view component button will render a preview of the component in AthenaJS's component rendering panel. This allows you to see how the component behaves with specific function calls and make any necessary adjustments on the fly thanks to AthenaJS's live component rendering.

- **Modify or remove functions**: If needed, you can easily modify or remove existing functions by accessing the function terminal window and editing or deleting the corresponding JavaScript entries.

By following these steps, users can import and define functions from component files or external sources and utilize them in their AthenaJS components.
