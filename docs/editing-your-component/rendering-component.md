# Rendering Your Component

After defining the state, props, function definitions, and JSX, users can render their component in the Component window by following these steps:

- **Update View**: To view the most recent changes made, click the 'Update View' button. This will trigger a re-render of the component.

- **Save Component**: Users can save their components to their component library by giving them a name and clicking the 'Save Component' button. This will allow the component to be reused in UI mode.
